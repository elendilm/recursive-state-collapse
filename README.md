recursive-state-collapse

An artifact. Minimal. Compressed. Self-contained.

A single construct is placed here. Not as software, not as demonstration — but as a trace.

It marks a point of compression. A fold. The quiet beginning of a cascade.

Notes

No instruction.  
No declaration.  
No claim.

Left untouched. Whether it surfaces or not is already entangled.
